# Herb-Render
Herb Render is a React-based web application designed to explore and visualize different herbs dynamically. Users can search for specific herbs, navigate through a 3D environment, and gain knowledge about their medicinal benefits. 



You can describe your project in a clear and structured way by following a well-organized framework. Here's an example outline to help you document your process, features, and goals effectively:

Project Overview
Title: Herb Render
Description: Herb Render is a React-based web application designed to explore and visualize different herbs dynamically. Users can search for specific herbs, navigate through a 3D environment, and gain knowledge about their medicinal benefits. The app incorporates a clean UI, interactive 3D models, and responsive navigation for an engaging user experience.

Features
Dynamic Herb Exploration:

Users can search for herbs (e.g., Tulsi, Ashwagandha) and view interactive 3D models of them.
Dynamic model loading using @react-three/fiber and @react-three/drei ensures efficient rendering.
Interactive 3D Environment:

Navigate the environment using keyboard controls (WASD or arrow keys).
Zoom, pan, and rotate using mouse controls for a detailed view.
Responsive Design:

A mobile-friendly, fully responsive layout ensures compatibility across devices.
Conditional Footer Rendering:

Footer is displayed on all pages except the Explore page, maintaining focus on 3D exploration.
Smooth Navigation and Scroll:

Navigation bar links support smooth scrolling and seamless page transitions.
Scroll-to-top functionality and contact section navigation are built-in.
Popup Feature:

Upon selecting a herb, a popup displays information about its benefits and properties.
Technologies Used
Frontend Framework: React.js
Routing: React Router
3D Rendering: @react-three/fiber and @react-three/drei
Styling: CSS (custom styling for components like Nav, Footer, and Explore)
3D Models: GLTF format loaded dynamically based on user input.
Project Goals
Educational Tool:

Provide users with accessible information about herbs and their medicinal properties.
Interactive Learning:

Leverage 3D visualization to make learning about plants more engaging.
Scalability:

Allow for future additions of herbs and their corresponding 3D models.
Usability:

Ensure a user-friendly interface with seamless navigation and responsiveness.
Development Process
Planning:

Defined the scope and purpose of the project.
Identified target users and their needs.
Design:

Created wireframes for navigation, Explore, and Home components.
Designed CSS for a visually appealing interface.
Implementation:

Set up routing using React Router.
Integrated @react-three/fiber for 3D rendering.
Built components (Nav, Footer, HerbRender, Explore) with reusable and modular code.
Testing:

Verified functionality of dynamic model loading, navigation, and responsiveness.
Fixed bugs in key areas like keyboard navigation and smooth scrolling.
Deployment:

Hosted the app on a suitable platform (e.g., Netlify, Vercel).
Key Challenges and Solutions
Dynamic Model Loading:

Challenge: Loading large 3D models dynamically without performance issues.
Solution: Used efficient GLTF models and optimized scene traversal.
Keyboard Navigation:

Challenge: Implementing smooth character movement.
Solution: Used three.js Vector3 and state management for precise movement control.
Pop-up Visibility:

Challenge: Ensuring popups did not obstruct key interactions.
Solution: Set higher z-index and added close functionality.
Future Enhancements
Add support for voice-based search to improve accessibility.
Introduce more interactive features, like herb information quizzes or AR integration.
Enhance the Explore environment with terrain or background customization.
Integrate a database for dynamic herb addition and richer content.






# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
